"""
 A set is an unordered collection data type that is mutable, iterable,
 and does not allow duplicate elements. Sets are commonly used for
 membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical
 operations like union, intersection, and difference.

 Sets have unique values, unordered hence canâ€™t be accessed with indexing
